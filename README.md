This project integrates Unity3D bindings for [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) to run OpenAI's Whisper ASR model locally on Meta Quest 3. Based on the original [whisper.unity](https://github.com/macoron/whisper.unity) repository by @Macoron.

## Features
- High-performance inference of Whisper ASR model
- Supports around 60 languages
- Can translate between languages
- Runs entirely on Meta Quest 3 without Internet connection
- Free and open source

## Project Details
This project uses the Whisper model to transcribe a sample scene with JFK's audio file containing his famous line: "Ask not what your country can do for you â€“ ask what you can do for your country." The transcription tests were conducted to measure latency on the Meta Quest 3 headset.
